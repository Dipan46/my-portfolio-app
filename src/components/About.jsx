        <p>
          Hello! I'm Dipan Basak, a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student at the Institute of
          Engineering and
          Management, Kolkata. Over the past few years, I have developed a passion for web development, with a
          particular
          focus on front-end technologies. My journey in web development began with basic HTML and CSS, and I
          have since
          expanded my skills to include JavaScript, React.js, and various other tools and frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my existing skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch with me if you would like to collaborate or learn
          more about my
          work.
